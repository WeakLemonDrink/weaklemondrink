# weaklemondrink

This is the source code for my personal website. This site will include my thoughts on engineering, coding or whatever else. I haven't used traditional social media because I wanted to code the site myself, plus I want to see whether anything I put on here reaches an audience all on it's own. I want an outlet for some of the thoughts I have from time to time, and a portfolio of the projects I've completed.

I've written this site using django and the wagtail CMS.
